ASSIGNMENT  C

Function design and modularization .create a document that describes the design of two  modular functions: one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci  number. include pseudocode and a brief explanation of how modularity 

pseudocode

function factoria
if n == 0 or n == 1 then
return 1
else
return n * factorial(n - 1)
end if
end function



Fibonacci number


fibonacci(n)
if n <= 1 then
return n
else
previous = 0
current = 1
for i from 2 to n do
next = previous + current
previous = current
current = next
end for
return current
end if
end function
